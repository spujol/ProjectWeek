# Project Description

- [Presentation](https://medtec4susdev.github.io/3DSlicerTrainingNetwork/projectdemo)

The main objective is the creation of training materials that could be adapted for 3D Slicer new users with both: medical and engineer profiles. This plan will focus on the needs and characteristics of the developing countries of Cape Verde, Senegal and Mauritania, and the training material will be oriented towards the creation of digital learning objects. 

## Objective

1. Establish a training plan for both profiles: clinicians and engineers of developing countries.
1. Support trainig materials in multiple languages
1. The creation of a hub where professionals can find learning objects to configure their own courses.

## Approach and Plan

1. Review and consult about the training material.
1. Study and determine how to adapt this material for professionals in the developing countries.
1. Plan the development of learning objects according to the agenda of the training guide.
